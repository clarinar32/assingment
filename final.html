  <p>The roses usually on high demand,<img src="img/rose.jpeg" alt=""width="201"height="201">have several major classes <strong>that we all have</strong></p>
  <p style="padding:10px">The best-known and most-popular class of rose is that of the hybrid tea roses, which accounts for the majority of roses grown in greenhouses and gardens and sold in our florist shops allover the country.
    Hybrid teas come in the complete range of rose colours and have large symmetrical blossoms. Hybrid teas resulted
    from the crossbreeding of frequently blooming but fragile tea roses with vigorous hybrid perpetual roses.
    Polyantha roses are a class of very hardy roses that produce dense bunches of tiny blossoms. Floribunda roses are hardy hybrids that resulted from crossing hybrid teas with polyanthas.
    which are pygmy-sized plants bearing tiny blossoming flowers.</p>
